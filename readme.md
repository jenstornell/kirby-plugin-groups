![Version 0.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.3-blue.svg) ![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg) [![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/give-donation-yellow.svg)](https://www.paypal.me/DevoneraAB)

Include, exclude, sort and use groups for your plugins.

**Plugin folder example**

```text
__plugin-manager
kirby-blueprint-reader
load-first--group
  kirby-dependencies
  kirby-init-class
seo--group
  kirby-seo
  kirby-sitemap-query
```

**[Installation instructions](docs/install.md)** - Make sure the plugin folder name is `__plugin-manager`.

## Create a group

To keep it simple, I will use `seo--group` from the example above.

1. Create `seo--group` folder. By default `--group` suffix makes it a group.
1. Move some plugins into `seo--group`.

### Group prefix

For the manager to be aware of that a folder is a group, the suffix `--group` is added at the end of the folder name.

Be aware that if you change it to an empty string, all folders that does not have a matching file will be seen as a group. It means that all subfolders will be treated as plugins.

```php
c::set('plugin.manager.suffix', '--group');
```

## Filter and sort plugins

### Include and sort

The array param `$plugins` contains the default plugins. The plugins will be sorted in the order you place them.

You can return the plugins as key/value pairs or like here, just as values. `$plugins` has a key that is the name and a value that is the path to the plugin file.

```php
c::set('plugin.manager', function($plugins) {
    return [
        'load-first--group/kirby-init-class',
        'seo--group',
        'kirby-blueprint-reader',
    ];
});
```

### Exclude plugin(s)

[PHP unset](http://php.net/manual/en/function.unset.php) supports multiple variables as well.

```php
c::set('plugin.manager', function($plugins) {
    unset($plugins['seo--group/kirby-seo']);
    return $plugins;
});
```

### Exclude group(s)

To exclude a group, we need to use `$group`. We can exclude a single plugin with a `string`, or multiple groups with an `array`.

```php
c::set('plugin.manager', function($plugins, $group) {
    $plugins = $group->unset('seo--group', $plugins);
    return $plugins;
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Includes

If you have a plugin inside a group that include one or more files with [roots](https://getkirby.com/docs/cheatsheet#roots), it will not work.

```php
include kirby()->roots()->plugins() . DS . 'plugin-name' . DS . 'subfolder';
```

If you have a plugin inside a group that include the files with a relative path, it should work just fine.

```php
include __DIR__ . DS . 'plugin-name' . DS . 'subfolder';
```

### Dependencies

In very rare cases, a plugin can be dependent on another plugin. If you are using include and groups, make sure that the plugins are loaded in the correct order.
